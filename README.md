# Gilbert 21 universal
Gilbert 21 universal is a progressive web app (PWA) and successor to the [Gilbert 21 Android app](https://github.com/burkmarr/G21App). The Android app has not been developed for some time and is no longer functional on recent releases of Android.

This app uses [PWA technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) to provide practically the same functionality as the old Android app but with the advantage that it is easier to develop and deploy. It also has the potential to be used on devices other than those running Android (e.g. iPhone).

The files generated by this app have the same format as those produced by the previous Android app and can therefore be used with the [Gilbert 21 desktop application](https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21) in exactly the same way.

Further development of this G21 PWA will concentrate on replacing some of the functionality of the desktop app so that all the work required to produce CSVs of biological records suitable for upload into applications such as [iRecord](https://irecord.org.uk/) can be done within this one app which runs both on mobile and desktop devices. Thus it is envisaged that the G21 PWA with eventually replace the Giblert 21 desktop application, just as it has done the Android app.

## Installing the app on your phone
To install this app, open the browser on your phone when you have an internet connection and navigate to this URL:
https://burkmarr.github.io/g21u

As a PWA the app will cache all of the resources it needs to run offiline when you first open it. So you will be able to use it in the field even when you have no internet connection.

Another PWA feature is that you should be able to install the app to your phone so that its icon appears on your homescreen just like any other app.

If you are using Chrome on Android, click the three dots in the top right ofthe browser and look for the **Add to Home Screen** link. When you click that, you should be offered the option to install to your phone.

## How to use the app
Although the app should be easy to understand intuitively, there follow some instructions on how to use it. In particuarl there are several ways in which the sound files it produces might be exported to your desktop environment (e.g. for use with the Gilbert 21 desktop).

There are three screens of the app - these are dealt with below.
