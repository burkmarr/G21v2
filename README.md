# Gilbert 21 PWA readme
The Gilbert 21 PWA (progressive web app) is a successor to the [Gilbert 21 Android app](https://github.com/burkmarr/G21App). The Android app has not been developed for some time and is no longer functional on recent releases of Android.

This app uses PWA technology to provide practically the same functionality as the old Android app but with the advantage that it is easier to develop and deploy. It also has the potential to be used on devices other than those running Android (e.g. iPhone).

The files generated by this app have the same format as those produced by the previous Android app and can therefore be used with the [Gilbert 21 desktop application](https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21) in exactly the same way.

Further development of this G21 PWA will concentrate on replacing some of the functionality of the desktop app so that all the work required to produce CSVs of biological records suitable for upload into applications such as [iRecord](https://irecord.org.uk/) can be done within this one app which runs both on mobile and desktop devices. Thus it is envisaged that the G21 PWA with eventually replace the Giblert 21 desktop application, just as it has done the Android app.

## How to use the app
Although the app should be easy to understand intuitively, there follow some instructions on how to use it. In particuarl there are several ways in which the sound files it produces might be exported to your desktop environment (e.g. for use with the Gilbert 21 desktop).

There are three screens of the app - these are dealt with below.
