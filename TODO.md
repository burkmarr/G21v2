# TODO
- Add mapping details
  - Add click event to generate new GR/lat-lng plus button to use for selected record.
  - Add ctrls to change between 10, 8, 6 and 4 fig GR.
  - Add option to set preferred GR precision.
- Locations from geoservices? (e.g. nominatim)
- Adding custom locations
- Adding custom taxa
- Adding custom fields (iRecord extra fields) & make gridref/latlong either or both.
  - Will need to revisit CSV export
- Update checked records from selected record
- New page for dealing with CSVs
  - delete CSV
  - archive CSV (only where OS file system support)
  - download CSV
  - share CSV
  - combine CSVs
- For native file system have folder options for deleted sound files and deleted records. If set, deleting sound file or record just moves the associated files to those folders instead of deleting completely (same for CSV)
- When all is done, rethink buttons
  - could there be a collapsible element to toolbar? e..g to hide the remove metadata and remove soundfile until needed? Or what about like the QGIS button groups where you click selector and change the function of the button (e.g. for the qgis select buttons)
  - could play sound and duplicate button go on middle toobar?
  - Or maybe sound should recieve foucus 
  - look at how focus moves on record details - try to make record entry as efficient as possible. Next should get focus when save button used.
