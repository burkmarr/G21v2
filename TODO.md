# TODO
- Dealing with lat/lon
- Add mapping details
- Adding custom locations
- Adding custom taxa
- Adding custom fields (iRecord extra fields)
  - Will need to revisit CSV export
- New page for dealing with CSVs
  - delete CSV
  - archive CSV (only where OS file system support)
  - download CSV
  - share CSV
  - combine CSVs
- For native file system have folder options for deleted sound files and deleted records. If set, deleting sound file or record just moves the associated files to those folders instead of deleting completely (same for CSV)
