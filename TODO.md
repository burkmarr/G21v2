# TODO

- Extend record list menu bar to work for 'field' info on main screen with separated menu items
  - mapping
  - taxonomy
  - metadata
    - original wavfile details (as now)
    - list of when the file was downloaded (or download attempted)
    - list of when the file was shared (or share attempted)
    - will need an explanation of 'attempt' if that is necessary
    - amount of storage available
  - These should behave like tabs
  - On mobile, the record details should be added to this menu so all appear together.
- Different taxon searches should operate for common and scientific names. I don't think there's a way to limit search to either via the API so I would need to filter the api output.
- Sharing - keep button but test if browser permits (Firefox doesn't) and if user tries it on one of these browsers present a modal which explains that it won't work and suggest a browser that does!
- Recorder panel needs some text that indicates when no record selected
- Record list needs some text that indicates when no records to list
- Record download, share & CSV inclusion attempts in metadata in record json (txt)
- json (txt) file should be created upon wav creation, but full record fields only added for v2 - v1 compat should only be used to record metadata
- If metadata shows that a file is downloaded, shared or exported to a CSV, indicate in the record list with icons
- Will need something to clear this metadata (by type) for all checked records - in case where there is a failure that the software cannot detect.
- Need to request persisitent storage
