# TODO
- If metadata shows that a file is downloaded, shared or exported to a CSV, indicate in the record list with icons
- Will need something to clear this metadata (by type) for all checked records - in case where there is a failure that the software cannot detect
- Need a button for deleting sound file
- Need a button for duplicating a record (maybe this goes on record itself)
- Dealing with lat/lon
- indexDB
- OS File system storage
- Adding custom taxa
- Add mapping details
