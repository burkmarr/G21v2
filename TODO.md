# TODO
- Need to request persisitent storage
- Add storage statistics to metdata?
- json (txt) file should be created upon wav creation, but full record fields only added for v2 - v1 compat should only be used to record metadata
- Metadata should consist of following:
    - list of when the file was downloaded (or download attempted)
    - list of when the file was shared (or share attempted)
    - will need an explanation of 'attempt' if that is necessary
    - amount of storage available
- Sharing - keep button but test if browser permits (Firefox doesn't) and if user tries it on one of these browsers present a modal which explains that it won't work and suggest a browser that does!
- Record download, share & CSV inclusion attempts in metadata in record json (txt)
- If metadata shows that a file is downloaded, shared or exported to a CSV, indicate in the record list with icons
- Will need something to clear this metadata (by type) for all checked records - in case where there is a failure that the software cannot detect.
- Dealing with lat/lon
- Add mapping details
